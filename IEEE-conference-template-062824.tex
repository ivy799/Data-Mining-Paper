\begin{abstract}
Landslides are common natural disasters in hilly regions, particularly in Indonesia, often causing significant economic and social damage. While rainfall is widely recognized as a key trigger, soil physical properties such as texture, bulk density, pH, and organic matter content also play a critical role in landslide susceptibility. This study investigates the influence of soil characteristics on landslide risk and develops a predictive model using data mining. Three primary datasets, Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD), Global Landslide Catalog(GLC) and country borders from Natural Earth, were integrated for analysis. Statistical tests \textit{t}-test and Mann–Whitney \textit{U} and the XGBoost algorithm were applied. Results show that subsoil properties contribute more to landslide risk than topsoil AUC 0.7205 vs. 0.6984, with the combined model yielding the best performance AUC 0.85. These findings highlight the importance of subsoil properties in slope stability and landslide prediction, offering valuable insights for improving early warning and mitigation systems.

\section*{Acknowledgment}

The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without 
an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B. 
G.) thanks $\ldots$''. Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''. Put sponsor 
acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.

\section*{References}

Please number citations consecutively within brackets \cite{b1}. The 
sentence punctuation follows the bracket \cite{b2}. Refer simply to the reference 
number, as in \cite{b3}---do not use ``Ref. \cite{b3}'' or ``reference \cite{b3}'' except at 
the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference \cite{b3} was the first $\ldots$''

Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at 
the bottom of the column in which it was cited. Do not put footnotes in the 
abstract or reference list. Use letters for table footnotes.

Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use 
``et al.''. Papers that have not been published, even if they have been 
submitted for publication, should be cited as ``unpublished'' \cite{b4}. Papers 
that have been accepted for publication should be cited as ``in press'' \cite{b5}. 
Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and 
element symbols.

For papers published in translation journals, please give the English 
citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation \cite{b6}.
